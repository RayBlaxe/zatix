# Documentation Reorganization Summary

**Completed**: January 2025  
**Impact**: Major documentation restructuring for better organization and accessibility

---

## 🎯 Objective

Clean up and consolidate the project's markdown documentation, which had grown to 12 files in the root directory with overlapping content and unclear organization.

## ✅ What Was Done

### 1. Root Directory Cleanup

**Before**: 12 markdown files cluttering the root
```
CLAUDE.md
DEVELOPMENT-WORKFLOW.md
FEATURES.md
HOMEPAGE_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md
MIDTRANS_PRODUCTION_CONFIG_SUMMARY.md
MOBILE_IMPROVEMENTS.md
QUICK_FIX_SUMMARY.md
README.md
REGISTRATION_OTP_ANALYSIS.md
ROADMAP.md
script.md
script2.md
```

**After**: 1 clean markdown file
```
README.md  ← Simplified project overview
```

### 2. Documentation Consolidation

**Created `docs/PROJECT_GUIDE.md`** - Single comprehensive guide combining:
- ✅ CLAUDE.md (architecture and development guidance)
- ✅ FEATURES.md (feature inventory and status)
- ✅ ROADMAP.md (development priorities and roadmap)
- ✅ DEVELOPMENT-WORKFLOW.md (development process)

Result: **One complete guide** instead of 4 separate files

### 3. New Organizational Structure

Created logical folder hierarchy in `docs/`:

```
docs/
├── README.md              # Documentation index and navigation
├── PROJECT_GUIDE.md       # Complete development guide (consolidation)
├── TODO.md                # Active tasks and progress tracker (new)
│
├── iterations/            # Sprint tracking (preserved)
│   ├── iteration-02-verification.md
│   ├── iteration-04-events.md
│   ├── iteration-05-ticket-purchase.md
│   └── iteration-homepage-enhancement.md
│
├── bugfixes/              # Bug tracking (preserved)
│   ├── otp-verification-500-error-diagnostic.md
│   └── registration-flow-fix-2025-01-15.md
│
├── technical/             # Technical guides (new folder)
│   ├── MIDTRANS_CONFIG.md
│   ├── MIDTRANS_QUICK_REF.md
│   ├── mobile-app-development-prompt.md
│   └── mobile-app-issue-template.md
│
└── archives/              # Historical summaries (new folder)
    ├── HOMEPAGE_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md
    ├── QUICK_FIX_SUMMARY.md
    ├── REGISTRATION_OTP_ANALYSIS.md
    ├── MOBILE_IMPROVEMENTS.md
    ├── MIDTRANS_PRODUCTION_CONFIG_SUMMARY.md
    ├── EVENT-PIC-TESTING-GUIDE.md
    ├── event-staff-management-implementation.md
    └── implementation-milestone-1-complete.md
```

## 🔄 Future Maintenance

### Keep Updated
1. **TODO.md** - Update after each sprint/milestone
2. **PROJECT_GUIDE.md** - Update when architecture changes
3. **iterations/** - Add new iteration docs as sprints complete
4. **bugfixes/** - Document significant bug resolutions

### Keep Clean
- Move completed summaries to `archives/`
- Archive old iteration docs once milestones complete
