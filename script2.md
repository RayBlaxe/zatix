1. Has the backend API already been updated to support the new hierarchy (staff under events vs. EO)?
> yes already updated, but i havent provided it to you yet, if you want you can ask specifically what are the new endpoints needed for certain features to works
2. Are there new API endpoints for event-level staff management that need frontend implementation?
> yes, there are new endpoints for managing event-level staff, including assigning and removing staff from events. so there are 1 more roles that is event pic to handle
3. What specific changes need to be made to the frontend to accommodate the new Event PIC role and event-level staff management?
> the frontend will need to implement new UI components for managing event-level staff, including the ability to assign and remove staff from events. this may involve updating existing components or creating new ones specifically for event-level staff management.
4. Should I analyze any specific API documentation or backend code to understand the new structure?
> yes, reviewing the API documentation for the new endpoints and any related backend code will be important to understand how to properly implement the frontend changes.

Questions for feedback:

1. Role System Complexity: The three-tier role system is quite sophisticated - would you like me to add more specific examples of how roles interact with different dashboard sections?
> so there are 3 main roles that is super admin, eo owner, and event pic, and then there are sub roles under the event pic, that is crew, finance, and cashier. so the super admin can access everything, the eo owner can access everything related to their own eo, and events under the eo, and the event pic can access everything related to their own events. the crew, finance, and cashier roles have more limited access based on their specific tasks. if you want i can provide more specific examples of how these roles interact with different dashboard sections.


2. API Mock Patterns: Should I expand on the mock data patterns, or is the current level of detail sufficient for understanding the development workflow?
> If you feel that more examples or a deeper explanation would help clarify the process, please let me know. and can you make it the mock response make it more covered according to the endpoints used in the project, and able to toggled on environment variable, if it is not available or error response from the backend or if the env NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCKS=false set it to false, it will not use mock data, but if it is true or the backend give error response it will use mock data, and able to navigate to between each page without error.

3. Component Patterns: Are there any specific UI component patterns or conventions I should highlight that would be particularly helpful for AI agents?
> im honestly not sure about this one, if you have any suggestions please let me know

4. Documentation Dependencies: Should I emphasize more strongly the requirement to check the existing documentation files (CLAUDE.md, FEATURES.md, etc.) before making changes?
> yes please, because those files contain important context and guidelines that will help ensure consistency and alignment with the overall project goals. emphasizing this requirement will encourage developers to review these resources before implementing changes. especially on the claude.md because it contains the overall project context and iteration tracking, and on the /docs folder because it contains the iteration details and completion status of each feature. so you should get the context from there first before making changes.
