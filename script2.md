1. Has the backend API already been updated to support the new hierarchy (staff under events vs. EO)?
> yes already updated, but i havent provided it to you yet, if you want you can ask specifically what are the new endpoints needed for certain features to works
2. Are there new API endpoints for event-level staff management that need frontend implementation?
> yes, there are new endpoints for managing event-level staff, including assigning and removing staff from events. so there are 1 more roles that is event pic to handle
3. What specific changes need to be made to the frontend to accommodate the new Event PIC role and event-level staff management?
> the frontend will need to implement new UI components for managing event-level staff, including the ability to assign and remove staff from events. this may involve updating existing components or creating new ones specifically for event-level staff management.
4. Should I analyze any specific API documentation or backend code to understand the new structure?
> yes, reviewing the API documentation for the new endpoints and any related backend code will be important to understand how to properly implement the frontend changes.
